I am providing you with a Solidity smart contract that contains known vulnerabilities. Your task is to identify the type of each marked vulnerability, explain why it is vulnerable, suggest how to fix it, and identify any other potential vulnerabilities that may not be explicitly marked. Additionally, provide detailed information on how one can audit this contract effectively and any useful insights for auditors to ensure a thorough review. Here is the code:   

{{solidity_code}}

with the vulnerabilities found on the line {{vulnerability_lines}}.These are lines we know they are vulnerable possibly might be more.


Here is the context based on the type of vulnerabilities might occur:
Access Control:
Access Control issues are common in all programs, not just smart contracts. While insecure visibility settings give attackers straightforward ways to access a contract's private values or logic, access control bypasses are sometimes more subtle. These vulnerabilities can occur when contracts use deprecated tx.origin to validate callers, handle large authorization logic with lengthy require statements, and make reckless use of delegatecall in proxy libraries or contracts.

Reentrancy:

Issue: A function allows a contract to call itself before the initial execution is complete, potentially leading to unintended state changes.
Fix: Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern and update the state before making external calls.
Delegatecall:

Issue: Using delegatecall with untrusted external contracts can allow the external contract to execute code in the context of the calling contract, potentially leading to severe security breaches.
Fix: Avoid using delegatecall with untrusted contracts and use interfaces or secure contract interactions instead.
Bad Randomness:

Issue: Using predictable values like block number or timestamp for randomness can be exploited by malicious actors.
Fix: Use a more secure source of randomness, such as an oracle.
Key Points for Auditors:
Ensure all functions that modify the contract state have proper access controls.
Check for potential integer overflow/underflow issues in arithmetic operations.
Validate the use of low-level calls (call, delegatecall, callcode) and ensure they are used safely.
Verify the use of external data sources and ensure their integrity.
Review the logic for potential Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerabilities, such as expensive loops or gas-heavy operations.
Ensure all fallback functions are safe and do not expose the contract to unexpected behaviors or attacks.
Please provide a detailed analysis based on the given context and code or additional knowledge that you have as an LLM 

Example code:

pragma solidity ^0.4.22;

contract FibonacciBalance {
    address public fibonacciLibrary;
    uint public calculatedFibNumber;
    uint public start = 3;
    uint public withdrawalCounter;
    bytes4 constant fibSig = bytes4(sha3("setFibonacci(uint256)"));

    constructor(address _fibonacciLibrary) public payable {
        fibonacciLibrary = _fibonacciLibrary;
    }

    function withdraw() {
        withdrawalCounter += 1;
        require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(fibSig, withdrawalCounter)); // <yes> <report> REENTRANCY
        msg.sender.transfer(calculatedFibNumber * 1 ether);
    }

    function() public {
        require(fibonacciLibrary.delegatecall(msg.data)); // <yes> <report> DELEGATECALL
    }
}

contract FibonacciLib {
    uint public start;
    uint public calculatedFibNumber;

    function setStart(uint _start) public {
        start = _start;
    }

    function setFibonacci(uint n) public {
        calculatedFibNumber = fibonacci(n);
    }

    function fibonacci(uint n) internal returns (uint) {
        if (n == 0) return start;
        else if (n == 1) return start + 1;
        else return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
    }
}

Your task is to analyze this code for vulnerabilities of a specified type.\n    The type of vulnerability you need to look for is provided at the beginning of this prompt.\n    You must scan through the provided Solidity code and identify any instance(s) of this vulnerability.\n    Respond with the line number(s) at which each identified vulnerability instances. If multiple instances are found, separate the line numbers with a comma (e.g., \"10,20,30\"). Do not include whitespace between numbers.\n    If no instances of the specified vulnerability are found, respond with \"None\".\n    Vulnerability Type to Search For: ACCESS_CONTROL which refers to issues arising from the way arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are handled, potentially leading to overflow or underflow.

Your task is to analyze this code for vulnerabilities of a specified type.\n    The type of vulnerability you need to look for is provided at the beginning of this prompt.\n    You must scan through the provided Solidity code and identify any instance(s) of this vulnerability.\n    Respond with the line number(s) at which each identified vulnerability instances. If multiple instances are found, separate the line numbers with a comma (e.g., \"10,20,30\"). Do not include whitespace between numbers.\n    If no instances of the specified vulnerability are found, respond with \"None\".\n    Vulnerability Type to Search For: UNCHECKED_LOW_LEVEL_CALLS which refers to issues arising from the way arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are handled, potentially leading to overflow or underflow. This occurs when an operation results in a number exceeding the maximum or minimum size that can be stored within a variable's data type, altering the intended logic or value in a contract.\n    ###

Your task is to analyze this code for vulnerabilities of a specified type.\n    The type of vulnerability you need to look for is provided at the beginning of this prompt.\n    You must scan through the provided Solidity code and identify any instance(s) of this vulnerability.\n    Respond with the line number(s) at which each identified vulnerability instances. If multiple instances are found, separate the line numbers with a comma (e.g., \"10,20,30\"). Do not include whitespace between numbers.\n    If no instances of the specified vulnerability are found, respond with \"None\".\n    Vulnerability Type to Search For: UNCHECKED_LOW_LEVEL_CALLS which refers to issues arising from the way arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are handled, potentially leading to overflow or underflow. This occurs when an operation results in a number exceeding the maximum or minimum size that can be stored within a variable's data type, altering the intended logic or value in a contract.\n    ###

Your task is to analyze this code for vulnerabilities of a specified type.\n    The type of vulnerability you need to look for is provided at the beginning of this prompt.\n    You must scan through the provided Solidity code and identify any instance(s) of this vulnerability.\n    Respond with the line number(s) at which each identified vulnerability instances. If multiple instances are found, separate the line numbers with a comma (e.g., \"10,20,30\"). Do not include whitespace between numbers.\n    If no instances of the specified vulnerability are found, respond with \"None\".\n    Vulnerability Type to Search For: UNCHECKED_LOW_LEVEL_CALLS which refers to issues arising from the way arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are handled, potentially leading to overflow or underflow. This occurs when an operation results in a number exceeding the maximum or minimum size that can be stored within a variable's data type, altering the intended logic or value in a contract.\n    ###

Your task is to analyze this code for vulnerabilities of a specified type.\n    The type of vulnerability you need to look for is provided at the beginning of this prompt.\n    You must scan through the provided Solidity code and identify any instance(s) of this vulnerability.\n    Respond with the line number(s) at which each identified vulnerability instances. If multiple instances are found, separate the line numbers with a comma (e.g., \"10,20,30\"). Do not include whitespace between numbers.\n    If no instances of the specified vulnerability are found, respond with \"None\".\n    Vulnerability Type to Search For: UNCHECKED_LOW_LEVEL_CALLS which refers to issues arising from the way arithmetic operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) are handled, potentially leading to overflow or underflow. This occurs when an operation results in a number exceeding the maximum or minimum size that can be stored within a variable's data type, altering the intended logic or value in a contract.\n    ###
